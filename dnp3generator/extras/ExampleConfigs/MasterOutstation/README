-Master/Outstation Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we create a paired dnp3 Master and Outstation.
The OutStation and Master are seperate Entities here compared to the BufferChange Example
which are automatically generated.

To run this example, compile dnp3Generator, and execute with "Config.json" and specified lua file(s)
which should be located in ../LuaConfigs


----------------------------
Outstation Lua Configuration
----------------------------
The Outstation in this example has two lua files associated with it as an exercise:
        "Lua File":{"Outstation":["BasicSample1.lua", "BasicSample2.lua"]}
The LUA files are located in ../LuaConfigs.

We switch between the Lua Files using a designated trigger value defined
in Config.json as "k"

"Lua Switch Trigger":{"Outstation":"k"},

Once the dnp3Generator is started using this configuration, hitting "k" followed
by return will show a confirmation the lua scripts have changed.

----------------------------
Master Station Lua Configuration (optional)
----------------------------
The Master Station in this example has a single lua file associated with it:
        "Lua File":{"Master":["M1_Example_Smart_Reading.lua"]},

The LUA file is located in ../LuaConfigs.
A master station lua script is not required.

Similar to the Outstation Example, we can also define multiple Lua Files for
the Master Station to follow as well as define a trigger in the JSON file for switching
Example:
"Lua File":{"Master":["M1_Example_Smart_Reading.lua", "Another_Sample_File.lua"]},
"Lua Switch Trigger":{"Master":"l"},

Paired Outstation and Masters (such as the autogenerated example in BufferChange) can follow
a similar option using

"Lua File":{"Master":["M1_Example_Smart_Reading.lua", "Another_Sample_File.lua"], "Outstation":["ExampleFile1.lua","ExampleFile2.lua"]},
"Lua Switch Trigger":{"Master":"l","Outstation":"j"},

The switch trigger key can also be a string instead of a character.
