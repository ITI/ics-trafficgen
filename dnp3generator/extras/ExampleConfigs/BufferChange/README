-Buffer Change Example
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example configuration we take a simple Master/Outstation pair and
modify the event buffer.

To run this example, compile dnp3Generator, and execute with "Config.json". The specified lua file
is be located in ../LuaConfigs. make sure the path to the lua file is correct in the Config file.

This example uses:
    "Lua File":{"Outstation":["BasicSample1.lua"]}
The DNP3Generator will look for BasicSample1.lua (copy located in ../LuaConfigs) to generate values for OutStationOne

To further expand this, a master station can also have a lua file
The JSON would look similar to:
    "Lua File":{"Outstation":["BasicSample1.lua"], "Master":["MasterStationExample.lua"]}

If needed multiple lua files can be switched for each Outstation and/or Master Instance using specified key triggers.
The JSON to specify Multiple Lua Files looks like:
    "Lua File":{"Outstation":["BasicSample1.lua", "AnotherLuaFileExample.lua"]}

Then a trigger would be specified in the JSON via:
    "Lua Switch Trigger":{"Outstation":"letter or string to switch Outstation lua file","Master":"letter or string to switch Master lua file"}

The paired Outstation and Master can specify lua files for both
"Lua File":{"Master":["M1_Example_Smart_Reading.lua", "Another_Sample_File.lua"], "Outstation":["ExampleFile1.lua","ExampleFile2.lua"]},
"Lua Switch Trigger":{"Master":"l","Outstation":"j"},

The switch trigger key can also be a string instead of a character.
